## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   You must have the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed (version 3.10 or higher is recommended).
*   An IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
*   Desktop support enabled for your target platform (e.g., `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HatlunkarRishabh/auraflow.git
    cd auraflow
    ```
2.  **Get dependencies:**
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  **Run the Hive code generator:**
    This step is crucial. It generates the necessary files for the database to work.
    ```sh
    dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
    ```
4.  **Run the app:**
    Select your target device (e.g., a mobile emulator, Chrome, or your desktop) and run the application.
